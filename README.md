## Overview
built while learning essential HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts through Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). Figma design was provided by Scrimba, the app was built from scratch by me.

### The Challenge
#### Basic Requirements
- Make it responsive and mobile-first

#### Stretch Goals
- Make it your own: add custom images & content about your experiences
- Add new pages, e.g. page displaying your contact info
- Use JavaScript to hide all but 6 most recent post, and display the other posts after clicking "View More" button
- Responsive navigation displaying hamburger menu on smaller screens

## My Process
1. Create GitHub README
2. Task breakdown
3. Build mobile version of all pages - home page, article detail page and about me page
4. Extract reusable components (nav bar, footer) into a common file
5. Create utils file to store utility functions in
7. Build tablet version of all pages
8. Build desktop version of all pages
9. Testing and bug fixing
10. Submit for a code review
11. Implement fixes and changes suggested by the code reviewer
12. Deploy to Netlify
13. Update README

### Built With
HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS

### What I Learned
I definitely learned that CSS Grid is a very useful and powerful tool. I also did my best to make my code as modular as possible.

### Continued Development
I really enjoyed building this project very much because it is the first multi-page website I built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. I'm looking forward to building the next Scrimba solo project (Restaurant Ordering app) in order to continue practicing my JS skills!

### Time Commitment
The project took me a little under 11 hours to build. Fixes after code review, testing, deployment and GitHub README update took another 2.5 hours. TOTAL: 13.5 hours
